# Atlas

**Code-graph + coverage + audit toolkit for polyglot codebases.**

Atlas is the spiritual successor to [testreg](https://github.com/sosalejandro/testreg)
— rebuilt as a monorepo of SRP-focused library packages with a single
`atlas` CLI on top. Library consumers (like
[bmad-story-runner-cli](https://github.com/sosalejandro/bmad-story-runner-cli))
import individual packages directly; end users install one binary.

> **Status: Phase 0 — restructure in progress.** This repo carries
> testreg's full git history (commits document the lessons being
> applied). The legacy `cmd/`, `internal/`, `e2e/` directories are
> being migrated into `packages/` + `cmd/atlas/` + `internal/cli/`
> phase by phase. See `docs/architecture.md` for the target layout
> and `docs/migration-from-testreg.md` for the cutover plan.

## Documentation

- [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) — package boundaries + dependency direction
- [`docs/annotations.md`](./docs/annotations.md) — `@atlas:<kind> <id>` grammar
- [`docs/schema-v1.md`](./docs/schema-v1.md) — SQLite schema reference
- [`docs/migration-from-testreg.md`](./docs/migration-from-testreg.md) — cutover guide for testreg users

## Install

```
go install github.com/sosalejandro/atlas/cmd/atlas@latest
```

For a specific tagged release, swap `@latest` for the version you want
(e.g. `@v0.1.2`). See [Releases](https://github.com/sosalejandro/atlas/releases)
for the full version history and changelog — releases are cut automatically
by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from
conventional-commit messages on `main`.

After install, verify with `atlas --version`. If the version reports `dev`
instead of a semver, you installed from a non-tag ref (commit hash or
branch) — for reproducible pinning use a tagged release.

## License

Same as the testreg repo this was forked from.
